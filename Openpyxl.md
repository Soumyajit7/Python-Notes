Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of various operations you can perform using the `openpyxl` library, including how to delete cell data, row data, and column data.

### Basic Operations

1. **Loading a Workbook**:
   ```python
   import openpyxl as excel
   wb = excel.load_workbook('TestData/Employee.xlsx')
   ```

2. **Accessing Worksheets**:
   ```python
   ws = wb['Emp']
   ```

3. **Accessing Cells**:
   ```python
   cell = ws.cell(1, 1)  # Refers to cell 'A1'
   cell = ws['A2']       # Refers to cell 'A2'
   ```

4. **Reading Cell Values**:
   ```python
   value = ws.cell(4, 10).value  # Value of cell 'J4'
   value = ws['D10'].value       # Value of cell 'D10'
   ```

5. **Iterating Over Cells**:
   ```python
   for row in ws['A1':'C4']:
       for cell in row:
           print(cell.value, end=' ')
       print()
   ```

### Advanced Operations

1. **Inserting Rows and Columns**:
   ```python
   ws.insert_rows(2)  # Insert a row at index 2
   ws.insert_cols(3)  # Insert a column at index 3
   ```

2. **Deleting Rows and Columns**:
   ```python
   ws.delete_rows(2)  # Delete the row at index 2
   ws.delete_cols(3)  # Delete the column at index 3
   ```

3. **Appending Data**:
   ```python
   ws.append([6, 'Payal', 10000, 'Lex'])  # Adding as a list
   ws.append((7, 'David', 10000, 'Lex'))  # Adding as a tuple
   ```

4. **Saving the Workbook**:
   ```python
   wb.save('Employees.xlsx')
   ```

### Deleting Cell Data

To delete the data in a specific cell, you can set its value to `None`:
```python
ws['A1'].value = None  # Deletes the data in cell 'A1'
```

### Deleting Row Data

To delete an entire row:
```python
ws.delete_rows(2)  # Deletes the second row
```

### Deleting Column Data

To delete an entire column:
```python
ws.delete_cols(3)  # Deletes the third column
```

### Additional Useful Methods

1. **Iterating Over Rows and Columns**:
   ```python
   for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=ws.max_row, min_col=1, max_col=ws.max_column):
       for cell in row:
           print(cell.value, end=' ')
       print()
   ```

2. **Accessing All Rows and Columns**:
   ```python
   all_rows = tuple(ws.rows)
   all_columns = tuple(ws.columns)
   ```

3. **Accessing Cell Values Row-wise and Column-wise**:
   ```python
   for row in ws.values:
       for value in row:
           print(value, end=' ')
       print()
   ```

4. **Finding Specific Data**:
   ```python
   emp_id_to_match = 3
   for row in range(2, ws.max_row + 1):
       if ws.cell(row, 1).value == emp_id_to_match:
           for cell in ws[row]:
               print(cell.value, end=' ')
           break
   ```

These operations should cover most of your needs when working with Excel files using `openpyxl`.
